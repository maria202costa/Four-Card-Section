## My process

Starting with the project introduction texts, the two titles and a small description, styling each component one by one, with text-align e fixing the sizes, weights and colors. Starting with organizing the cards with display flex, and arranging the spaces of the main in relation to the intro with margin. Within the cards, using padding to organize the space between the elements and translate to move the image to the correct position, on all cards. For the mobile version, organizing the cards with CSS grid, and fixing the texts by modifying their font-sizes, paddings and margins.

### Built with
